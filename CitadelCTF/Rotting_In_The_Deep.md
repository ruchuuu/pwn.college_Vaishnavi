# 10. Rotting In The Deep

  ## DESCRIPTION
  A soft ring of presence settles around the chamber, the kind that marks a true landing: from here, it will ask for more and, in return, grant more. Etched into its surface is a sequence of numbers, worn and faint, as if time itself is eating them away. A whisper from the echoes guides you:
  The message lies beneath the surface. Push it three steps forward in the cycle of life, and only then will the words emerge from the void.

  ## WRITEUP
  According to the hint, the flag is converted to an integer with each digit shifted by 3 places, which is the caeser cipher. Reversing or deciphering this gives the flag with the python code and integer output already provided for it.
