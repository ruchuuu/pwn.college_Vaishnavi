# 3. track 8

  ## DESCRIPTION
  Bypassing the second chamber leads to an empty floor except for a single artifact in the center: an old MP3 player, scratched and worn. On its surface, a cipher is etched, a message left behind for anyone who can decode it  

  twj eys zpr ukm 'viamnwqw' bx lzgo: esmqqui{yyr_oshwwcm_bwupa}  

  When you power it on, the sound fills the chamber. The tracks play like whispers from a lost world, and you recognize it as a song from Panchikoâ€™s latest studio album, particularly track no. 8. Its title feels familiar, hinting at a famous cipher. Decrypt it by using the album name as your key and continue your ascent.
  ## WRITEUP
  Cipher text= twj eys zpr ukm 'viamnwqw' bx lzgo: esmqqui{yyr_oshwwcm_bwupa}  
  Key= Ginkgo  
  track 8- Vineger  
  This implies that we have to use the Vigenere cipher. Putting the cipher text and key through an online decipher gives the flag.
