# 8. Selected Ambient Work

  ## DESCRIPTION
  A single song keeps echoing through the floor, repeating in a haunting loop. Amid the sound, you find a note left by a past candidate. It hints that the song holds a secret message, hidden in plain sight, much like how Aphex Twin concealed his face within his music with the help of spectrograms. To move forward, you must find the message hidden in this sound.

  ## WRITEUP
  As per the hint given in description, download the .wav file and view its spectrogram on an online site. It gives a portion in between where we see 'citadel{...}' writen. In between the curly brackets is the morse code for the characters of the flag. Jot this code down and put it through a morse code decoder to get the flag.
