# 6. Rotten Apple

  ## DESCRIPTION
  Among the debris of this floor, you find a relic of sound: An album which turns out to be D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L by Panchiko, a long lost album. But the music is warped, as though it has undergone disc *rot*.  
  The path forward is hidden in the distortion. Similar to how the album was warped, the password to the next floor has been warped first by a factor of 47, then by a factor of 13. Untangle these changes to reveal the code and continue your ascent.  
  4:R256=Y3oRRoP0#~%Ro?A
  ## WRITEUP
  'rot' and factor of 13 and 47 suggest the use of rot13 and rot47 cipher.  
  Ciphertext= 4:R256=Y3oRRoP0#~%Ro?A  
  Unrot the rot13 cipher first and then the rot47 on an online decoder to get the flag.
